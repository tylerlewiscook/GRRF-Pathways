# GRRF-Pathways

This repository contains R code to reproduce the breast cancer application results in "Using Guided Regularized Random Forests to Identify Important Biological Pathways and Genes" by Tyler Cook, Daniel Brumley, and Sounak Chakraborty.  The BreastCancer.R file can be used to complete the entire analysis.  Running the script will load the data from the original source, perform the analysis, and create a CSV file to save the results.  The files in the Data folder are backups of the original data sets.  It is not required to download these files to run the analysis.
